Manages EC2 nodes with Capistrano, iClassify and Puppet.

Requires:

	capistrano 2+
	right_aws (gem install right_aws)

Configure:

	First, populate the config/ec2.rb file with your EC2 info, iClassify URI, and the location of your puppet server.
	
  Update the ec2/simple.rb with an Ubuntu AMI, pre-configured with:

		1. An authentication scheme that matches your puppet master (users with matching passwords)
		2. icagent, facter and puppet
		
	I started with the Ubuntu Hardy AMIs.
